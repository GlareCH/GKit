### About GKit
I use GKit in my own projects, try to make iOS development convenient and fast.
 In fact, there are still lots work to do to make GKit a ‘real’ open source project.
 I'm working on this!

### Support
Support iOS 5 and later  
Support ARC only  


### How To Use in CocoaPods
I havn't committed GKit to Pods, but you can also use it. To do so, put this code in your project's Podfile:  

    pod 'GKit', :git => 'https://github.com/GlareCH/GKit.git'
